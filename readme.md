# Unique Fishing
> adds some more "unique" catches to fishing

Goals
- catches should not be added without reason
- catches should server a purpose (ditto ^)
- catches should feel vanillaish

## Currently added catches

### guardian
> why are you here?

a guardian will pop out at you while fishing!

<details><summary>why?</summary><p>
	
this was added to

- prevent afk fish farms because
	- they provide infinite (provided there is a mending fishing rod) resources at no cost or time put in
	- the resource (enchanting books, enchantmented items, xp, and rare items) they provide in general at 	little to no cost unbalances the game in other areas making them significantly less useful

- create a new type of catch that feels new and unique, as the project name suggests

- feels like a vanilla solution to the problem present

### slime balls
> slimey

slime balls are now pulls when in swamp biomes

<details><summary>why?</summary><p>
	
this was added because

- between hunting slimes manually and creating a slime farm, there's a gap, hopefully this helps reduce the gap

- create a new type of catch that feels new and unique, as the project name suggests

- feels like a vanilla solution to the problem present
